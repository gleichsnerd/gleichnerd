    Hello! My name is Adam, but you can call me gleichsnerd if you'd like. I'm a Pennsylvania transplant living in Columbus, OH, and have been here for a little over a year now.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>By day, I'm a fullstack software engineer, working on anything and everything, from the front-most portions of webapps all the way back to database optimization, server scripting, and more. By night, I'm still a developer who also writes, camps, and starts weird projects like fixing a typewriter or reassembling an entire bicycle for fun and negative profit.
  </p>
  <br/>
  <p>
    I've worked on apps bringing <a href='https://twitter.com/lufthouse'>context-aware information into innovative places</a>, classes teaching programming concepts by <a href='https://github.com/fusecodecamp2017/BattleBuddies'>scripting bots in a Hunger Games style arena</a>, and <a href='http://www.cardinalhealth.com/en/services/acute/business-solutions/operational-solutions/inventory-management-services/cardinal-health-inventory-management-solutions.html'>inventory management solutions</a> that streamline patient care and cost in clinics across the country.
  </p>

    I primarily work in EmberJS, Java, and Ruby in my free time, but being a polyglot is in my DNA. Just take a look at some of the languages I've used (and abused) so far:

  <ul>
  {{#each usedLanguagesSorted as |language|}}
    <li class="margin-smallest">{{language}}</li>
  {{/each}}
  </ul>
